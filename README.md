- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheSwolyBible
- 👀 I’m interested in python based projects. I currently work in the Intelligence Community of the DoD.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Sec+, Net+, and C|EH in order to round out my professional skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment, but if something peaks my interest I'll reach out.
